# DetectionGV
In this repository, bioinformatic scripts are collected in the following folders:

- *0_WGSPipeline*  
  - This contains all scripts needed to analyze  whole genome, raw sequencing reads of bacterial transformation hybrids 
- *1_Detection*
  - With the output from *0_WGSPipeline*, different genetic variations in the hybrid's genomes can be detected.
- *2_GeneralScripts*
  - Here, general scripts are collected that are needed to sort and convert annotations as well as find gene orthologues with blast.
  
The original version of all scripts, as cited in the PhD thesis of Isabel Rathmann, is preserved on branch PhDThesis_Rathmann2023.
