## TheMaster Plan
.... What we have to do
- **A0_VariantFiltering**
- **A1_SNP2CNP** 
- **A2_Lists2Genes** (prior A2_CNP2Genes and A4_Regions2Genes)
  - here now you can also upload deldups or a randomn txt file 
  - you can upload a txt file with BSU names of genes that you are interested in to search for (if you dont want to go through the whole bed file with all 4422 genes ..)
  - you can also exclude the accessory genome now
- **A2b_Gene2Fcn** - Beta version available - (Mona)
- **A3_CNP2Operons** (Isa + Melih)
- **A5_Cov2DelDup** 
- **A6_CNP2AnchorRegions** - Analysis of sequence identity of potential recombination starting points (Mona)
