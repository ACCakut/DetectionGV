## Overview of the scripts 
In this folder, the scripts are provided with which different genetic variants can be detected. All scripts are implemented in MATLAB. The numbers of the scripts indicate the order in which they should be run. Here, we give a brief overview.

**A0_VariantFiltering**
- input: 
- output:
- The script takes the input and filteres the 

**A0c_AccessoryGenome**
- input: 
- output:
- The script takes the input and filteres the 

**A0d_Multimapper**
- input: 
- output:
- The script takes the input and filteres the 

**A1_SNP2CNP** 
- input
- output

**A2_Lists2Genes** (prior A2_CNP2Genes and A4_Regions2Genes)
- input
- output
  - here now you can also upload deldups or a randomn txt file 
  - you can upload a txt file with BSU names of genes that you are interested in to search for (if you dont want to go through the whole bed file with all 4422 genes ..)
  - you can also exclude the accessory genome now
 
**A3_Cov2DelDup** 
- input
- output
