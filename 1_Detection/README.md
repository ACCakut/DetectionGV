## The scripts in this folder:
In this folder, the scripts are provided with which different genetic variants can be detected. All scripts are implemented in MATLAB. The numbers of the scripts indicate the order in which they should be run. Here, we give a brief overview.

**A0_VariantFiltering**
- This script takes the list of called variants and filters by quality and read depth. This script is also used to filter the masterlist, which contains all SNPs detected between a recipient and donor species.

**A0c_AccessoryGenome**
- Here, we detect the accessory genome parts of one genome compared to a second genome. In these regions, no replacements can be detected. 

**A0d_Multimapper**
- This script allows us to find the regions on a genome to which multimapping reads align.

**A1_SNP2CNP** 
- With the filtered variant list and the masterlist, we detect the replacements of donor segments into the recipient. Here, we exclude accessory genome and multimapping regions.

**A2_Lists2Genes** 
- This scripts allows us to find the genes that are detected as genetically modified. The script accepts as input a plain list of start and end positions, the output generated by **A1_SNP2CNP.m**, as well as a list of SNPs. 
 
**A3_Cov2DelDup** 
- This script contains an algorithm that detects deletions and duplications. The input is the coverage of the aligned reads to the reference.
